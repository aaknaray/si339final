	<h2 tabindex="0">UT 103: The Incomplete City</h2>
		<p>The Incomplete City workshop offers a methodology to bring live decision-making into a studio environment where students are able to simulate city-making as a negotiated art and to do it in a way that brings immaterial decisions to life through an intensely visual (and physical) experience. Or in plain English: it's like having a debate by playing a very slow game of SimCity, drawn by hand, with 30 other people.</p>
	<h3>Learnings</h3>
		<p>User Group: Outdoor enthusiasts who are also savvy social media influencers
		Our task was to design a neighborhood to cater to our specific user group. We wanted to have various levels of outdoor enthusiasts, so we have a small city center, tiny homes in the forest, and empty forest space for recreational use. We have graffiti walls, beautiful scenery, and technology rental carts to satisfy their internet cravings. Finally, we established a bus loop and created bike lanes for transportation.</p>
		<p>After seven individual neighborhoods with contrasting user groups were designed, we worked to combine all the neighborhoods into one unified city. We established a larger public transportation system, created mountains, and added density to easily merge neighborhoods. All twenty of us created a self-sufficient government with different subcommittees to manage the workload and divide responsibilities.</p>
		<p> believe that this was an incredibly unique User Experience exercise. I learned so much about the importance of setting constraints in design. You can not do everything, so prioritizing the most important features our designated user group would appreciate was vital. Designing for everyone does not necessarily mean creating a maze of everything. I learned about compromise and the different techniques we can use to merge conflicting interests. We can add a mountain range to create a barricade between user groups, with utility for both user groups, or we can merge them together and remove aspects of our communities to do so effectively. </p>
	<h2 tabindex="0">Zest</h2>
		<p>MProduct is a campus community for students passionate about building great products. We are a close-knit group of designers, engineers, makers, and curious thinkers working together to launch, build, and improve today's products and break into product management careers.</p>
	<h3>Learnings</h3>
			<p>We aimed to solve two problems with this app. One, students face too many hurdles to sticking to healthy habits, such as cooking and conscious eating. Second, we wanted to limit leftover ingredient waste. Zest helps college students who consistently face challenges (time/money) with regard to cooking habits by providing recipes personalized to their level of cooking experience, budget, and allotted time for cooking. We are anti-delivery. By removing friction from and providing resources for cooking, we want to incentivize and elevate the personal cooking experience for University of Michigan students. Zest provides tailored suggestions for students to gradually build up their recipe books. We aim to capture loyalty and high engagement with our features to best guide our users.</p>
			<p>I worked with three other students on this awesome project. I learned a lot about collaborative design and we, as a group, are very pleased with the results. I learned a lot about the intricacies of Figma. Small details make a big difference. The typeface, color combinations, button sizes, button shapes, etc. They all have the impact to enhance a user's experience. I also learned about creating an identity for your product. Zest is for younger cooks, so we added a social platform and directed the user's experience from there. The emphasis on individualization and personalization in today's society is seen throughout the app, and when we presented it, we felt that the individualism of the app was an appealing feature.</p>
	<h2 tabindex="0">XPWOW</h2>
		<p>Reach Consulting Group is an undergraduate, student-run, non-profit organization providing advisory services in technology, digital strategy, UX/UI, and data & business analytics. We are affiliated with the University of Michigan's School of Information and have a strong emphasis on technology consulting.</p>
	<h3 tabindex="0">Learnings</h3>
			<p>Reach Consulting Group worked with The Auto Club Group (ACG) to explore the XPWOW platform and offer a student’s perspective on the redesign. ACG is also looking for guidance with regard to increasing engagement, so RCG was also tasked with brainstorming ideas to provide users an incentive to interact with the platform. RCG utilized inspiration from similar applications in social media, and our personal experience with those apps to help guide XPWOW’s redesign. Along with our completed mockups, Reach will offer explanations on how we envision the UX to work, and why we believe it will aid ACG in achieving its goals. RCG wholeheartedly believes the idea of an all-in-one travel-sharing platform is extremely cool, and our redesign is working to enhance the experience to make it fun and engaging.</p>
			<p>I worked with three other students on this project. I learned so much about meeting client expectations and designing for someone else. Communication and explanation are keys to success when dealing with clients. As the Project Manager for this, I truly managed every person and meeting, which meant the agency of the project was on my shoulders. That was a unique experience, but one where I believe I relished the opportunity. This was the beginning of my Figma journey, so I worked with simple shapes and designs. I used XPWOW's color schemes, so I did have some limitations in my design. Even so, I think researching the market you are in and taking inspiration from comparable examples is one step of the design process that can go a long way. However, XPWOW is a unique platform and certain features can hold that uniqueness for each app, even is the other 80% is similar to a comparable platform. </p>
