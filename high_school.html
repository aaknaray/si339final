	<h2>Civil Engineering & Architecture</h2>
		<p>Our Civil Engineering Architecture class was my introduction into the built environment. I really enjoyed working with Revit and Sketchup. I have created a "Practical" Dream House and a Balsa Wood Shed as the primary pieces of work from the course.</p>
    <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>Our Civil Engineering Architecture class assignment was to create a “practical” dream house. My intent was to design an open-concept, simplistic layout with modern furnishings. I enjoyed thinking about how to transform the space to make it functional and livable. The contrast of glass and wood textures is a primary focus of my modern exterior.</p>
        <p>Pictured above is also an engineering focused project done in my Civil Engineering Architecture course. The end product turned into a balsa wood model of the simple shed we diagrammed on Revit. It is important because it displayed my ability to work with my hands.</p>
    <h2>Columbia Summer Immersion</h2>
	<p>I also attended a three-week summer immersion program at Columbia University in New York City to explore the field of architecture further. Here, I worked on architectural hand drawings and created my version of Parc de la Villette off the High Line.</p>
    <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>To begin the Columbia University summer program, we used postcards to create our own 3D model and made perspective drawings of them.</p>
        <p>My final project for the Columbia program. The High Line is to the left of the rap battle arena. The stage is shaped like a tree trunk, the branches are suites, shaped as either, squares or triangles. Nature was a heavy influence in the postmodernist design of this space and was used to blend the High Line together with my design. </p>
